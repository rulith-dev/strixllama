# The patch set, and how it was audited

*This is the record of an audit run against the predecessor repository, kept because it explains why
the patch order is what it is and why five of these scripts were generated rather than written. The
tooling it names now lives in `bootstrap/bootstrap.py`.*

Audit of 2026-09-19, produced by `bootstrap/bootstrap.py --verify` and re-runnable at any
time. This exists because the repository accumulated 47 patch scripts across two backends, of which
only two were referenced from the manager or the scripts, and nothing recorded which ones produce the
binary that runs. Everything below is measured from the tree and the running process, not read off
documentation — one documentation claim turned out to be wrong (see IQ3_S).

## Upstream pin

    https://github.com/pwilkin/llama.cpp @ f5daaa3cfa6358e5dd398911ec741813745a5440

`bootstrap/UPSTREAM.json` carries the delta's provenance: for each of the 20 modified files, the
Git blob SHA-1 and SHA-256 it has upstream; for all 24, the SHA-256 the patch set produces. Those
two halves are what make the delta below provable rather than remembered — the first says what the
patches started from, the second what they must end at.

## The whole delta: 24 files

20 modified, 4 added, out of 3610.

| Area | Files |
| --- | --- |
| CUDA/HIP backend | `ggml-cuda.cu`, `mmb.cu`, `mmb.cuh`, `mmid.cu`, `mmvq.cu`, `softcap.cu`, `softcap.cuh`, `vecdotq.cuh` |
| added CUDA/HIP | `strixllama-chain.cu/.cuh`, `strixllama-getrows-cast.cu/.cuh` |
| llama core | `llama-context.cpp`, `llama-graph.cpp`, `llama-lazy-reader.h`, `llama-memory-hybrid-idx.cpp/.h`, `llama-memory-recurrent.cpp/.h`, `llama-model.cpp/.h` |
| model | `models/qwen4exp.cpp` |
| speculation / server | `common/speculative.cpp`, `tools/server/server-context.cpp` |

## The 17 patch scripts that are live

Verified by running each against a throwaway copy of the four source directories the patches touch
and keeping those that report "already applied". Each script gets a fresh copy, so one cannot mask
another.

    apply_chain_fusion            apply_qsa_block_key_cache
    apply_decode_timing           apply_qsa_decode_gather
    apply_getrows_cast_fusion     apply_qsa_kb_image_guard
    apply_graph_key_shape         apply_qsa_small_batch_mask
    apply_hip_ple_probe           apply_rs_pos_warn_stateless
    apply_iq3s_vecdot_hip         apply_skip_ops_ablation
    apply_mmvq_rdna35_rows        apply_spec_draft_ubatch
    apply_ple_overlapped_reads    apply_spec_timing
    apply_trunk_decode_twins

Six files are written by more than one script, so order matters when replaying onto a clean tree:

| File | Scripts, in the order they must run |
| --- | --- |
| `ggml-cuda.cu` | chain_fusion, getrows_cast_fusion, graph_key_shape, skip_ops_ablation, hip_ple_probe |
| `models/qwen4exp.cpp` | qsa_block_key_cache, qsa_decode_gather, qsa_small_batch_mask, qsa_kb_image_guard, hip_ple_probe |
| `llama-memory-hybrid-idx.cpp/.h` | qsa_block_key_cache, qsa_kb_image_guard |
| `strixllama-chain.cu/.cuh` | chain_fusion, getrows_cast_fusion |

Of the other 30 scripts, 29 do not apply to this fork at all — they target the Vulkan backend or
files this tree does not have — and one (`apply_mtp_pending_reset`) applies cleanly, meaning it is
not in the build.

## The gap: 5 modified files no script owns

`mmb.cu`, `mmb.cuh`, `softcap.cu`, `softcap.cuh`, `mmid.cu`.

**`mmid.cu` is a comment only**: a note recording that a counting sort was tried in place of the
bitonic expert sort and lost (906 against 946 t/s pp16384). No code change.

**The other four are the IQ3_S MMB kernel and the sigmoid fusion, and they are live in production.**
They exist only as whole-file copies in `patches/iq3s-kernel/`, with no `apply_*.py` script, so a
clean rebuild from the patch scripts alone would silently omit the single largest measured win in
the project: +4.8% prefill and +5.5% decode (pp16384 947.37 against 903.64, tg128 24.97 against
23.66), from letting the 52.2% of the model body stored as IQ3_S reach the matrix cores.

`patches/iq3s-kernel/README.md` states "It is not in production". That is wrong, on three
independent pieces of evidence:

1. The four files in that directory are byte-identical to the production tree.
2. `mmb.cu:921` passes `allow_iq3s = true` from the fused-GLU caller, with no runtime gate.
3. The running server logs `MMB_GLU fused gate/up+swiglu: ... type=IQ3_S`.

### Settled 2026-09-19: the rollback reason is obsolete, keep the kernel

The rollback was attributed by elimination, not root cause, and predates the real fix. On 2026-09-18
every "answer stops mid-sentence" report was traced to speculative verification batches running dense
attention with no causal mask, fixed by `apply_qsa_small_batch_mask.py`, which is live.

Re-measured on the current build. `STRIX_MMB_IQ3S=0` was added to `mmb.cu` so both arms are the
same binary with one variable; `tools/truncation_test.py --fill 70000 --reps 1`, fresh server per
arm, verified by `type=IQ3_S` appearing in one server log and not the other:

| | 68499-token prefill | answer | sections |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IQ3_S on | **876.7 t/s** | 1110 tokens, `finish_reason=stop` | **30/30** |
| IQ3_S off | 830.6 t/s | 1085 tokens, `finish_reason=stop` | **30/30** |

Both reach 30/30: the truncation is gone. Prefill is **+5.6%**, matching the +4.8% originally
claimed. The kernel stays, and `STRIX_MMB_IQ3S=0` stays as the switch to reach for when a future
numerics or long-generation regression has to be attributed.

(The decode rates in that test are not a comparison - it is a speculative run and the two arms drew
different draft counts.)

## The deeper gap: the scripts cannot rebuild the tree on their own

`ggml-cuda.cu` also carries unscripted content, and the counts line up exactly with the snapshot in
`patches/iq3s-kernel/`, not with anything the live scripts insert:

| marker in `ggml-cuda.cu` | production tree | all 17 live scripts | iq3s snapshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GGML_UNARY_OP_SIGMOID` | 11 | 0 | 11 |
| `scale_sigmoid` | 2 | 0 | 2 |
| `NO_SIGMOID_FUSE` | 2 | 0 | 2 |
| `LLAMA_GRAPH_DUMP` | 3 | 0 | 3 |
| `GT compute` | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| `mmb_supported_mmid` | 3 | 0 | 3 |

So the production tree is **snapshot first, scripts second** - the 17 scripts layer onto
`patches/iq3s-kernel/`, not onto clean upstream. `GT compute` is the `LLAMA_GRAPH_TIMING` line the
whole decode-budget analysis is built on, and it exists only in that snapshot.

A bootstrap therefore has three steps, and this order is not optional:

1. check out `pwilkin/llama.cpp` at `f5daaa3...`;
2. overlay the six files in `patches/iq3s-kernel/` (whole files, hash-verifiable);
3. apply the 17 live scripts, respecting the ordering table above.

## Replay result, 2026-09-19: 24 of 24 — the bootstrap is proven

    clean-upstream check: ok
    patches   : 21 applied, 0 failed
    REPRODUCED 24 / 24

Every file of the delta is byte-identical to the production tree, starting from a clean upstream
reconstructed from hash-verified downloads. `bootstrap/bootstrap.py --verify` re-runs it in a few minutes.

Getting there needed one ordering fix and five new scripts:

- **`apply_win_lazy_reader` must run first.** It installs the cross-platform lazy reader that later
  patches anchor against. It had looked dead because it was being run after the snapshot handed it
  its own finished output.
- **The snapshot must not supply `llama-lazy-reader.h`.** Same trap from the other side: give
  `apply_ple_overlapped_reads` the finished file and it reports "already applied" and skips the half
  of its work that lives in `qwen4exp.cpp`.
- Five scripts generated by `tools/make_patch_script.py` from the tree itself, with anchors grown
  until unique, replacing what had drifted or was never captured:

| New script | Closes |
| --- | --- |
| `apply_node_timing` | `STRIX_NODE_TIMING`, which existed only as an uncommitted edit |
| `apply_iq3s_vecdot` | supersedes `apply_iq3s_vecdot_hip`, whose anchors matched nothing |
| `apply_trunk_twins` | supersedes `apply_trunk_decode_twins`, written against a modified tree |
| `apply_ple_prefetch_launch` | the PLE prefetch half no script performed |
| `apply_mmid_sort_note` | the comment recording why the expert sort stays bitonic |

All five are idempotent, report "already applied" against the production tree, and modify nothing
when re-run.

### The audit that got here (kept for the reasoning)

`tools/replay_bootstrap.py` does exactly that and is re-runnable. Only 20 files differ from
upstream, so only those are restored: normally out of the clone's own git objects, addressed by the
blob hash in `bootstrap/UPSTREAM.json`, or with `--fetch` through a mirror and checked against the
recorded SHA-256 — all 20 verified either way. The reconstructed tree then matches upstream in every recorded file,
the snapshot goes on, the scripts run in the order above, and every delta file is compared.

    clean-upstream check: ok
    patches   : 15 applied, 2 failed
    REPRODUCED 17 / 24

So most of the build is now provably reproducible, and the seven that are not each have a named
cause. None of them is guesswork:

| File(s) | Why it does not reproduce |
| --- | --- |
| `ggml-cuda.cu` | `STRIX_NODE_TIMING`, the per-dispatch HIP event instrumentation, is in **no script and not in the snapshot** — an unrecorded edit straight into the tree |
| `mmid.cu` | comment-only note about a rejected counting sort; unrecorded, harmless, fold into the snapshot |
| `vecdotq.cuh` | `apply_iq3s_vecdot_hip` is stale: its `OLD_LOOP` anchor occurs in neither upstream nor the production tree, so the script can no longer produce what the tree contains |
| `models/qwen4exp.cpp` | the PLE prefetch half (`launch_prefetch` / detached thread) has no working script; `apply_hip_ple_probe` reports "already applied" and writes nothing |
| `llama-model.cpp`, `llama-model.h`, `llama-graph.cpp` | `apply_trunk_decode_twins` fails with "anchor not unique" against clean upstream — written against an already-modified tree |

All five were closed the same day; see the result at the top. Had they not been, a clean rebuild
would have silently omitted the node timing, the IQ3_S vec-dot, the PLE prefetch and the trunk
decode twins — which is the whole reason this audit exists.

    python bootstrap/bootstrap.py --fetch --patch    # download upstream once, then replay
    python tools/replay_bootstrap.py            # replay again offline

## How to re-check

    python bootstrap/bootstrap.py --record     # hash what the patch set produces
    python bootstrap/bootstrap.py --verify     # is this tree still exactly that?

A file that appears under `--delta` and is named by no live script is a reproducibility gap: the
build cannot be recreated from the patch set alone.

## Addendum 2026-09-21: `apply_iq3s_mmq_hip`

The delta is now 27 files (23 modified, 4 added); the replay reports 27 / 27. One script, four files,
last in the order because it rewrites the sign table `apply_iq3s_vecdot` added:

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/vecdotq.cuh` | the IQ3_S sign-byte mask becomes two multiplies (`strixllama_iq3s_sign_mask(s4)`) instead of a 16-entry device table; the mmvq vec-dot uses it |
| `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/mmq-load-tiles.cuh` | the IQ3_S MMQ tile loader on HIP: no `__vcmpne4`/`__vsub4` byte loops, grid read from the LDS copy |
| `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/mmq.cuh` | `mul_mat_q_process_tile` fills the LDS grid after the x tile (`mmq_get_nbytes_shared` reserves it); the fork's compact routed MoE path admits IQ3_S and IQ4_XS, not only IQ4_NL |
| `tests/test-backend-ops.cpp` | `STRIX_MOE_PERF` perf cases for this model's expert shapes (512 experts, 10 used, 640x2560 / 2560x640) |

Measured with `test-backend-ops perf -o MUL_MAT_ID` under `STRIX_MOE_PERF`: IQ3_S gate/up 123 -> 149 GB/s
at 8 tokens per step, 117 -> 157 at 16, 73 -> 156 at 32; IQ4_XS at 32 tokens 74 -> 170. See
`docs/results/concurrency-mtp-20260921.json` for the decode-level effect.

`tools/make_patch_script.py` learned to merge hunks whose anchors overlap after an earlier hunk has
been applied, and to replay its own output against the before-tree before writing it - the first
version of this script had four anchors in one loop body, of which the second no longer matched once
the first had been applied.

## Addendum 2026-09-21: `apply_prompt_cache_disk`

The delta is now 29 files (25 modified, 4 added); the replay reports 29 / 29. Three files, last in
the order because its server-loop anchors sit in text earlier scripts wrote:

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `tools/server/server-task.h` | `server_prompt_cache` gains a disk tier: an index of on-disk entries, `set_disk`, `persist`, `load_from_disk` |
| `tools/server/server-task.cpp` | the file format (tokens, target and draft state, checkpoints), writing on every RAM-cache insert, prefix-matched reads on a RAM miss, size-bounded eviction oldest first |
| `tools/server/server-context.cpp` | `STRIX_PROMPT_CACHE_DIR` / `STRIX_PROMPT_CACHE_MIB` wire it up after the RAM cache is created; `prompt_save` persists what it just captured |

Why it is a tier under the RAM cache and not a slot-file feature: the slot save/restore endpoints
carry the state but not the recurrent checkpoints, and without a checkpoint the server has to
re-process a hybrid model's prompt from the start ("forcing full prompt re-processing due to lack of
cache data") - measured: restore in 0.5 s, then 38 s of prefill anyway. The RAM cache entry is the
complete unit, so that is what goes to disk.


## Addendum 2026-09-21: `apply_multi_stream_qsa`

The delta is now 30 files (26 modified, 4 added); the replay reports 30 / 30. Four files, 38 hunks,
last in the order because its anchors sit in text the earlier scripts wrote:

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `src/llama-memory-hybrid-idx.h` | `qsa_mixed_inputs` (two membership inputs) threaded through `set_input_qsa_blocks` |
| `src/llama-memory-hybrid-idx.cpp` | the block-key cache gap check per token and per sequence; `qsa_scalar_visibility` accepts several sequences; the compact fill writes `seq_blk` / `seq_tok` |
| `src/models/block-graph.inc` | `qwen4exp_apply_compact_visibility` folds `seq_blk^T seq_tok` (exactly 0/1) into the visibility |
| `src/models/qwen4exp.cpp` | the decode gather batched on the flash-attention sequence axis with f16 rows (limit 32 queries); the membership inputs built, set and checked for reuse; `dirty_max` grows with the sequence count |

Why: with more than one slot the server's equal-length split puts several sequences in one ubatch.
The sparse path declined those, so they ran dense attention over the whole pool (four users 35K
deep: 28 tok/s together against 32 for one alone), a multi-stream step tripped the sticky block-key
cache gap flag for every stream, and the mixed reserve graph kept a dense f16 mask of n_kv × ubatch
that the driver would not fill at 262144 × 8192. Measured in `docs/results/concurrency-mtp-20260921.json`
(`multi_stream_qsa_20260921`): four users 35K deep 33–39 tok/s, four slots at 262144 × 8192 load
and cost 1.3 GB over one. `src/models/block-graph.inc` joins the upstream side of the delta
(`bootstrap/UPSTREAM.json`).

## Addendum 2026-09-21: `apply_small_m_mmvf`

Three files already in the delta (still 30 files, replay 30 / 30), 10 hunks:

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/ggml-cuda.cu` | a few-row F32/F16 src0 (≤ 64 rows) with 9–64 columns runs the vector kernel over column chunks of 8 instead of falling through to cuBLAS |
| `tools/server/server-context.cpp` | `STRIX_SPEC_TIMING` splits "other" into pre / post / gap |
| `tests/test-backend-ops.cpp` | `STRIX_DENSE_PERF` (the big Q8_0 projections, 8 distinct matrices so the working set beats the MALL) and `STRIX_SMALL_PERF` (the few-row shapes) |

Why: a 16-token verify step (four slots) ran the hyper-connection inject `[10240 × 4]` at 117 µs
and the GDN beta/alpha `[2560 × 48]` at 37 µs per call through cuBLAS — 95 + 72 calls per pass —
because `mul_mat_f` declines a src0 narrower than its row tile and the vector kernel stops at 8
columns. With chunks: 13 and 10 µs; the bare 16-token pass 139.8 → 130.4 ms. Measured in
`docs/results/concurrency-mtp-20260921.json` (`pass_budget_20260921`).

## Addendum 2026-09-22: `apply_cache_ram_and_mtp`

Three files already in the delta (still 30 files, replay 30 / 30), 17 hunks, after
`apply_prompt_cache_disk` because it rewrites the tier that one adds:

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `tools/server/server-task.h` | `persist()` overload taking the buffers, `has_disk()`, `disk_wants()` |
| `tools/server/server-task.cpp` | persist from buffers the RAM tier does not own; a media guard that can fire; rank disk candidates by the tokens they skip; say why a scan drops a file and remove one that can never be read; print what was on the shelf when nothing is taken; keep the target state when the entry has a draft one and this server does not draft, and refuse the reverse |
| `tools/server/server-context.cpp` | `prompt_save()` gathers into a temporary and writes to disk when the RAM tier declines the state |

Why: `--cache-ram` defaults to 8192 MiB, which was ~8 GB of system memory on a machine whose carve
leaves 31.6 GB, and it could not simply be turned down — `alloc()` refuses an over-limit state and
`persist()` only ran on states `alloc()` accepted, so a small limit would have stopped long
conversations reaching disk at all. Measured in `docs/results/prompt-cache-20260922.json`: resident
8.07 GB → 4.13 GB over the same four conversations, the 79K-token one 96.6 s of prefill → 17.3 s,
and MTP off no longer aborts the server on a cached conversation.

## Addendum 2026-09-22: `apply_spc_direct_io`

One file already in the delta (still 30 files, replay 30 / 30), 13 hunks, after
`apply_cache_ram_and_mtp` because it replaces the reader that patch leaves behind:

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `tools/server/server-task.cpp` | `spc_file`: unbuffered sequential reads through one aligned 8 MiB staging buffer on Windows, `std::ifstream` elsewhere; the read log line splits file time from buffer time; a file that cannot be opened is no longer treated as corrupt and deleted |

Why: a 5.630 GiB entry read at 505 MB/s while the drive gives 3451 MB/s unbuffered, and a copy of the
file written in one pass reads no faster — the cost was the page cache taking a copy of every GiB of
data that is read once and handed to the GPU. Now 1656 ms at 3482 MB/s, and a full cache hit on the
79K-token conversation takes 8.1 s instead of 18.1 (96.6 s cold). Note that `windows.h` defines `near`
as a macro, so the miss-line variable is `closest`.

## Addendum 2026-09-23: `apply_disk_tier_v2`

Three files already in the delta (still 30 files, replay 30 / 30), 62 hunks, after
`apply_spc_direct_io` because it rewrites the disk tier that and the two patches before it built:

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `tools/server/server-task.h` | the store's index (entries, refcounted chunks and checkpoints), the writer's queue and thread, checkpoint paging |
| `tools/server/server-task.cpp` | manifest + `ckpt/` + `chunks/` layout; content-defined chunking (gear hash, XXH3-128 names); one background writer that is the only thing that deletes; streaming conversion of version 1 entries; a startup scan that sweeps `.part` files and unreferenced objects; direct-I/O writes as well as reads |
| `tools/server/server-context.cpp` | `prompt_save` hands the state to the writer (and can skip the RAM tier); block writes when all slots are idle; checkpoints paged out when idle and back in for a rewind; `make_room` before a completion; `try_clear_idle_slots` takes the least recently used slot and writes it first |

Why: switching between two long conversations cost ~5-6 s because every idle slot was saved and cleared
on each new task, and each save wrote the whole state - 5.7 GB for a 79K-token conversation - at once.
Measured in `docs/results/disk-tier-v2-20260923.json`: switches 0.3-0.4 s, a block write 0.52 GiB,
checkpoint paging 5.86 -> 2.78 GB of working set, restores token-identical after a kill.

Before release it went through three independent reviews (concurrency, formats and crash safety,
slot lifecycle) and now also carries their fixes: checkpoints a queued save or a warm slot depends on
are pinned in the store; entries live in a directory named after the model and its file; checkpoint
files end with an XXH3-128 and are read against the manifest's sizes; a v1 conversion places the new
manifest before dropping the old file; startup leaves alone what it cannot open; the writer wakes the
main loop after each job; see `review_20260923` in the results file.

`tools/make_patch_script.py` changed with it: when fine hunks do not replay, nearby hunks are merged
with a doubling gap before falling back to one hunk for the whole span. This patch was 12247 lines as
one hunk and 2243 as 18; with the review fixes it is 2652 lines as 62.

## Addendum 2026-09-23: four patches after 0.1.7

The delta is now 33 files (29 modified, 4 added): `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/qsa.cu`, `ple-conv.cu` and
`include/llama.h` join the upstream side of `bootstrap/UPSTREAM.json`. Replay 33 / 33, 31 patches.
Measured in `docs/results/perf-round-20260923.json`.

| patch | files | what |
|---|---|---|
| `apply_hc_q8_fusions` | `mmb.cu`, `ggml-cuda.cu`, `ple-conv.cu` | the HC gate kernel (GEMM + sigmoid + stream mix) and the tall 384-row tile for Q8_0 weights, and the PLE conv fusion for an F32 weight - Unsloth's types, which left `LLAMA_HC_GATEMIX` and `LLAMA_PLE_CONV` inert. The Q8_0 gate kernel reads the streams in F32 and keeps the gate in F32, so it is bitwise the unfused path; the PLE match also refuses a graph in which anything outside the fused taps reads the concat's body |
| `apply_qsa3_bitonic` | `qsa.cu` | QSA3 selection rows sorted with a bitonic sort instead of an O(ns^2) rank sort (after pwilkin/llama.cpp 38477e8c); same rows |
| `apply_disk_restore_lazy` | `server-task.h`, `server-task.cpp`, `server-context.cpp` | a version 2 entry's chunks read by four threads, its checkpoints left in the store and pinned for the slot like paged-out ones: 5.63 GiB / 2724 ms became 2.33 GiB / 734 ms for a 79K-token conversation |
| `apply_ple_pregather` | `llama.h`, `llama-context.cpp`, `llama-lazy-reader.h`, `qwen4exp.cpp`, `server-context.cpp` | `llama_strix_prefetch`: the server gathers the next prompt batch's PLE rows while the current one computes, and that batch's `set_input` takes them; the prefetch hook, which `llama_decode` calls for every model, no longer casts a model of another architecture |

Every one of them was checked for identical output: 48 greedy tokens with their top-5 logprobs for the
fusions and the sort, the tokens of a continue / rewind / return sequence for the restore, the generated
text of a 95.6K-token prefill for the pregather.

## Addendum 2026-09-23: `apply_state_copy_trim`

`ggml/src/ggml-cuda/gdn-conv.cu` joins the delta (34 files, 30 modified, 4 added); replay 34 / 34, 32
patches. Two hunks: `build_conv_state_at` copies each rollback slot's conv-state tail straight out of
the concat instead of through a cont (144 fewer dispatches in a 4-token verify pass), and the GDN conv
fusion's matcher accepts that copy as a reader of the tail, so prefill keeps the fusion. Pure copies:
the output is bitwise the same; a verify pass measured 59.40 -> 58.90 ms.

## Addendum 2026-09-23: `apply_moe_glu3`

No new files in the delta (34: 30 modified, 4 added); replay 34 / 34, 33 patches. Measured in
`docs/results/moe-glu3-20260923.json`.

| patch | files | what |
|---|---|---|
| `apply_moe_glu3` | `mmb.cu`, `test-backend-ops.cpp` | `mmb_tile_gemm_glu3`, the IQ3_S expert gate/up + SwiGLU: the dequantization spread over the block (four threads per row), the sign on an F16 copy of the grid so the scale product is one `v_fma_mix` (exact, so the same BF16), raw bytes kept whole until the dequantization, uniform-base addressing and native-vector prefetch registers, the valid-fragment dispatch out of the step loop, big tiles from 32 rows. 35.9 -> 19.9 ms a layer at 8192 tokens on a recorded routing; `STRIX_MMB_GLU3=0` runs the previous kernel, `STRIX_MMB_GLU_DUMP` records a routing. test-backend-ops: the `MOE_GLU` case (`STRIX_MOE_GLU_PERF`, also in test mode) and `STRIX_MOE_IDS_FILE`, which replays a recorded routing |

Checked for identical output: 48 greedy tokens with their top-5 logprobs at every step, and the text
generated after a 95.6K-token prefill. The prefill of that text went 889.7-892.9 -> 969.4 t/s.

## Addendum 2026-09-23: two patches for several slots

`src/prefix.h` joins the delta (35 files: 31 modified, 4 added); replay 35 / 35, 35 patches. Measured in
`docs/results/multi-slot-20260923.json`.

| patch | files | what |
|---|---|---|
| `apply_qsa_active_blocks` | `llama-memory-hybrid-idx.cpp`, `.h`, `qwen4exp.cpp`, `prefix.h` | with several slots the cache is one pool, and the sparse-attention block list of a batch held every conversation's blocks, the idle ones only to be marked invisible. It now holds the batch's own sequences (`qsa_active_blocks`), sized from their positions: one conversation beside 70K tokens of idle ones 47.6 -> 44.8 ms/token (one slot: 44.1), a prefill beside them 999 -> 1064 t/s. Bitwise the same for a conversation with at least the selection budget of blocks; a shorter one can move in the last bits. `LLAMA_QSA_ACTIVE_BLOCKS=0` turns it off |
| `apply_state_read_coalesce` | `llama-context.cpp` | a slot's state is read from the device one run of nearby cell ranges at a time instead of one range at a time: saving a conversation decoded alongside others took 6-10 s with the whole server waiting; 347 -> 44 ms in the probe, the same bytes |

## Addendum 2026-09-23: one run of cells per conversation

`src/llama-kv-cells.h`, `src/llama-kv-cache.cpp`, `src/llama-kv-cache.h`, `src/llama-graph.h` and
`ggml/src/ggml-alloc.c` join the delta (40 files: 36 modified, 4 added); replay 40 / 40, 38 patches.
Measured in `docs/results/kv-regions-20260923.json`.

| patch | files | what |
|---|---|---|
| `apply_kv_regions` | `llama-kv-cells.h`, `llama-kv-cache.cpp`, `.h`, `llama-graph.cpp`, `.h`, `llama-memory-hybrid-idx.cpp`, `.h`, `qwen4exp.cpp`, `prefix.h` | with several slots every conversation keeps one run of the pool, in slot order: its tokens go after its last cell, a new one starts after the last with room left to the one before it, and a batch that does not fit has the pool laid out again first - the conversations keep their order and slide, each one of the batch gets the same room after it, idle ones none (device copies of K/V, indexer keys and block keys, queued on the graphs' stream in `init_batch`). A batch's graph views only the run of its own conversations. One conversation beside idle ones computes bitwise what it computes on one slot, MTP included, at the same speed (MTP 32.8 -> 38.5 tok/s beside 70K idle tokens; one slot 37.8); block keys go stale per sequence. `LLAMA_KV_REGIONS=0` turns it off, `LLAMA_KV_WINDOW=0` the window, `LLAMA_KV_REGION_MOVES=0` the moves; `LLAMA_KV_REGION_HEADROOM` sets the room |
| `apply_compute_buffer_headroom` | `ggml-alloc.c` | compute buffers get 3% + 16 MiB of headroom: a graph a few MiB larger no longer frees and reallocates the 3.4 GiB target buffer, whose commit ROCm on Windows keeps - the intermittent "bad allocation". Four conversations: peak commit 90.4 -> 83.7 GB, with 6.9 GB to spare instead of 0.18. `GGML_ALLOC_COMPUTE_PAD=0` turns it off, `GGML_ALLOC_DEBUG=1` reports reallocations |
| `apply_alloc_failure_report` | `server-context.cpp` | a failing `operator new` prints its size and call stack before the server reports "bad allocation" |

## Addendum 2026-09-24: `apply_empty_slot_cache`

No new files in the delta (40: 36 modified, 4 added); replay 40 / 40, 39 patches. Measured in
`docs/results/kv-pool-20260924.json`.

| patch | files | what |
|---|---|---|
| `apply_empty_slot_cache` | `server-context.cpp` | a slot named by id that holds nothing takes the prompt-cache path: `f_keep` was 0/0 there, a NaN that compares false, so a 173K-token conversation sent back to its emptied slot was processed again from its first token (186 s) although the disk tier held all of it; now it is read back (7 s) |

## Addendum 2026-09-24: disk tier version 3

`tools/server/server-context.h` and `tools/server/server.cpp` join the delta (42 files: 38 modified, 4
added); replay 42 / 42, 41 patches. Measured in `docs/results/disk-tier-v3-20260924.json`.

| patch | files | what |
|---|---|---|
| `apply_qsa_kb_rebuild_f16` | `qwen4exp.cpp` | the graph that rebuilds the block-key cache (a conversation's first, and the first after a restore or a checkpoint rewind) scores with the keys read back from the cache, in F16, as every later graph does - it scored with the F32 keys it had just computed, so a restored conversation and a resident one selected slightly different blocks on their next batch (same tokens, logprobs up to 0.34 apart). Perplexity at ctx 4096 unchanged to four places at ubatch 4096 and 512, and identical to the cache switched off |
| `apply_disk_tier_v3` | `llama.h`, `llama-context.cpp`, `llama-kv-cache.cpp`, `.h`, `llama-memory-hybrid-idx.cpp`, `.h`, `server-task.cpp`, `.h`, `server-context.cpp`, `.h`, `server.cpp` | `llama_strix_kv_*`: a sequence's attention rows (KV cache and indexer) read and written by position, and cells allocated for a restore. The disk tier keeps a conversation's rows in runs of 4096 positions, each written once as it fills and named by its XXH3-128; the recurrent state only when the conversation leaves memory - a short last run, the state at its end and its last prompt's two latest checkpoints - when another conversation needs its cells or `POST /strix/persist` asks (the manager does before a stop). A restore allocates the cells, streams the runs in with the next read under way and puts back the latest checkpoint they reach. The store keeps only the format the server writes for the model: entries of an older one (version 1 anywhere, version 2 where rows are served) are deleted as it opens, with the objects only they named, and the version 1 conversion is gone |

Checked bitwise against the same conversations kept resident in a pool that holds both: a 173K and a 155K
conversation swapped through a one-conversation pool, and two 33K chats taking ten turns with five
evictions, gave the same tokens and the same top-3 logprobs at every step that carries them.

## Addendum 2026-09-24: two patches after 0.1.13

No new files in the delta (42: 38 modified, 4 added); replay 42 / 42, 43 patches. Measured in
`docs/results/slot-state-guard-20260924.json`.

| patch | files | what |
|---|---|---|
| `apply_slot_state_guard` | `server-context.cpp` | GitHub issue #1. Every place the server caught an exception mid-turn released the slot and kept its conversation, although part of a batch had been recorded in its tokens and not run (or run and not recorded) - under commit exhaustion std::bad_alloc comes from ordinary work, and the next request then fed the recurrent state positions it had seen or skipped ("non-consecutive token position"); with one slot, its tokens left in a batch nobody owned aborted the server on an assert. A slot that throws now leaves the batch being built and loses its conversation, as a decode error already made it, and so does every slot the pre-decode, decode and post-decode handlers catch. Before a prompt batch the slot's tokens must match its memory, or the prompt is processed from its start. `STRIX_FAULT=<site>:<n>` (ckpt, decode, post) throws on the n-th pass, for tests |
| `apply_disk_ckpt_step` | `server-context.cpp`, `server-task.h` | a leaving conversation's older checkpoints go to the disk tier as well, one every 32768 tokens, each written once: a conversation read back from disk kept only its last prompt's, and a deeper rewind (an agent trimming an early tool result) processed it again from its first token |

With them the manager passes `--ctx-checkpoints 8 --checkpoint-min-step 32768`: a resident conversation keeps its
last prompt's checkpoints and one per 32K tokens, at most 0.9 GB of system RAM a slot instead of 3.5.

## Addendum 2026-09-24: 0.1.15

No new files in the delta (42: 38 modified, 4 added); replay 42 / 42, 44 patches. Measured in
`docs/results/vision-disk-20260924.json`.

| patch | files | what |
|---|---|---|
| `apply_disk_v3_vision` | `server-context.cpp` | with a vision projector loaded every prompt counts as a media prompt to `server_tokens::get_tokens()`, which asserts `!has_mtmd`; version 3 of the disk tier called it to compare a prompt with the runs already written, so the server aborted ~10 s into the first long prompt whenever the disk tier and image input were both on (0.1.13, 0.1.14). It reads the text tokens, which a prompt without media has exactly as many of. The check `apply_slot_state_guard` added skipped every slot while a projector was loaded; it now skips only prompts that hold media, whose positions run ahead of their cells |

## Addendum 2026-09-24: Q8_0 K/V

`ggml/src/ggml-cuda/cpy.cu` joins the delta (43 files: 39 modified, 4 added); replay 43 / 43, 46 patches. Measured in
`docs/results/kv-q8-20260924.json`.

| patch | files | what |
|---|---|---|
| `apply_kv_q8_0` | `cpy.cu`, `ggml-cuda.cu`, `qsa.cu`, `llama-memory-hybrid-idx.cpp`, `llama-kv-cache.cpp`, `qwen4exp.cpp`, `server-task.cpp`, `.h`, `server-context.cpp` | a Q8_0 K/V cache for qwen4exp. The sparse prefill kernel (qsa3) reads K and V only through packed f16 layouts, so the graph dequantizes a Q8_0 cache into them (a Q8_0 -> f16 copy kernel) and the kernel accepts the type; the decode gather and the block-key rebuild read Q8_0 rows through the same get_rows. The indexer's keys stay f16. V is not rotated for this architecture: qsa3's matrix-core sums move in the last bit with the V of keys they weight by zero (free cells after a conversation's end, holding an earlier conversation's data), and the inverse rotation spread that far enough that a conversation read back from disk parted from the resident one. The disk tier deletes entries whose rows are another size, as it does older formats |
| `apply_state_hash_debug` | `server-context.cpp`, `server-task.cpp` | debugging aids, off unless set: `STRIX_STATE_HASH` logs hashes of a slot's recurrent and whole state as a task starts, after every prompt batch and as a conversation leaves; `STRIX_V3_VERIFY` reads every restored run back and checks it against its name |

## Addendum 2026-09-24: 0.1.17

No new files in the delta (43: 39 modified, 4 added); replay 43 / 43, 49 patches. Measured in
`docs/results/concurrency-20260924.json`.

| patch | files | what |
|---|---|---|
| `apply_spec_draft_by_slots` | `server-context.cpp`, `speculative.cpp` | `STRIX_SPEC_DRAFT_BY_SLOTS` caps a step's draft by how many slots generate ("3,2,2,0": 3 for one, 2 for two or three, none from four): in this MoE a verified token reads ~10 more experts' weights, which conversations decoding together cannot share, so several at once verify fewer tokens (four: 37.9 -> 47.4 tok/s summed). The MTP draft stops at the caller's cap instead of drafting to its own and being truncated |
| `apply_kv_zero_freed` | `llama-kv-cache.cpp`, `.h` | a freed cell's rows are zeroed (seq_rm, seq_keep, a move's vacated cells, clear), by async copies from a zero tensor kept in each cache buffer, on the graphs' stream. The matrix-core sums of the sparse attention moved in the last bit with the values of keys weighted by zero - the free cells after a conversation's end - so results depended on who used them before. V stays unrotated for qwen4exp: the disk tier's q8_0 conversations are stored so, in rows of the same size |
| `apply_mtp_carry_state` | `speculative.cpp`, `server-context.cpp`, `server-task.cpp`, `.h` | the MTP drafter's carried target row keeps its position (zeros when it does not belong) and goes with checkpoints (`data_spec`), the RAM tier's entries, the disk tier's restore point and child slots; a restored slot file clears it. After a rewind the first draft-cache row was computed from a stale row, so the same prompt drafted differently twice and greedy output parted at a near-tie |

## Addendum 2026-09-25: 0.2.0

Eight files join the delta (51: 47 modified, 4 added): `gated_delta_net.cu`, `.cuh`, `hc-cn.cu`, `.cuh`,

| `apply_gdn_direct_rows` | `llama-memory-recurrent.cpp`, `.h`, `llama-graph.cpp`, `.h` | when every sequence of a batch reads its recurrent state from a row of its own cell (its newest state, or a rollback snapshot after rejected drafts), `build_rs` marks the state gather ('SGIP' in `op_params[0]`) and the HIP backend reads the rows `s_copy` names straight from the cache instead of gathering them into scratch (3 MB a sequence a layer). The condition is `s_copy_own_cell`, which unlike `s_copy` consumes no rollback index, and every hybrid input's `can_reuse` compares it |
| `apply_ple_unbuffered_cache` | `llama-lazy-reader.h`, `llama-model.cpp` | the per-layer-embedding table read with `FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING`, 16 requests in flight on each of 16 workers, and no buffered handle or mapping of the file left open (either drops unbuffered reads to ~8K IOPS): a cold 2K-token gather 240 -> 58 ms. The rows read are kept raw in a direct-mapped RAM cache (`STRIX_PLE_CACHE_MB`, default 400) |
| `apply_prefill_kernels_020` | `ggml-cuda.cu`, `mmb.cu`, `.cuh`, `gated_delta_net.cu`, `.cuh`, `hc-cn.cu`, `.cuh`, `idx-relu-sum.cu`, `.cuh`, `qsa.cu`, `.cuh`, `top-k.cu`, `qwen4exp.cpp` | the hyper-connection inject computed inside the combine-norm kernel; narrow F32 weights on their own kernels; F32 GEMMs from 9 columns on WMMA instead of hipBLAS (whose kernels load from disk on first use: 20-400 ms stalls); BF16 activation rows padded off the memory channels' 4 KB stride; the indexer's strip score in one kernel; TOP_K as a register radix select (same selected set); the QSA key/value packs in one pass from the cache; the attention gate's copy and sigmoid in one kernel; a 16-row gated delta net prefill kernel. The copy fusions read their source while they write, so `graph_optimize` keeps the source allocated until the output is computed. Bitwise to 0.1.17 with `STRIX_HC_INJECT_FUSE=0 STRIX_GDN_R16=0 STRIX_SKINNY_F32=0 STRIX_MMB_F32_MIN_T=512` |
